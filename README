You will need to install mvn (maven), 
Maven will download other Java dependencies automatically.

However, you must separately install the shared library part of java-libglom.
for instance, for Ubuntu via the libjava-libglom-java package 
from the PPA for stable releases:
  https://launchpad.net/~openismus-team/+archive/ppa
or from the PPA for unstable releases:
  https://launchpad.net/~openismus-team/+archive/openismus-glom-unstable/+packages

To build the .war package, do:
  mvn clean package

*** Notes:

We are using the default GWT compilation option of compiling the Java code to
obfuscated JavaScript. The reason for this is covered by this snippet from the
GWT developer docs:

“obfuscation reduces the size of the generated JavaScript files, making them
faster to download and parse”
