** Building:

You will need to install mvn (maven), 
Maven will download other Java dependencies automatically.

To build the .war package, do:
  mvn clean package

To see test reports, and other stuff, by doing:
  mvn site
and then viewing target/site/index.html in your browser.


More documentation is on the glom wiki:

*** Building the source tarball ***

To build a source tarball, do:
  mvn assembly:single

This uses the maven-assembly-plugin, which is configured (in pom.xml) to use 
our assembly.xml file.


*** Notes:

We are using the default GWT compilation option of compiling the Java code to
obfuscated JavaScript. The reason for this is covered by this snippet from the
GWT developer docs:

“obfuscation reduces the size of the generated JavaScript files, making them
faster to download and parse”
