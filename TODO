Here's a list of TODO items / ideas in no particular order.


Improvements to LayoutListView:

* Implement column width size as specified in the glom file.

* Implement column alignment (automatic, left, right) as specified in the glom file.

* Add support for LayoutItem_Text, LayoutItem_Button and LayoutItem_Image items.

* Make width of the CellTable used for the LayoutList consistent between the
  tables so that the UI doesn't appear to jump around. One way to do this is to
  find the width of the largest table and enlarge the column widths
  proportionally in the smaller tables. Of course this will not respect the
  column widths specified in the glom file. Another option is to pad the smaller
  tables with empty columns at the end so that the line under the headers extends to
  the end of the largest table. Some experimentation is required to see which option
  is the best.


Improvments to LayoutDetailsView:

* This hasn't been started yet.
